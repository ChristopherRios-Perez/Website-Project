Kennedy and college student Claire Redfield as they navigate through the zombie-infested Raccoon City. The game takes place two months after the events of the first Resident Evil game and features a dual storyline that allows players to experience the events from both characters' perspectives.

As they investigate the mysterious outbreak, Leon and Claire encounter a variety of horrifying creatures, including zombies, mutated monsters, and the deadly Tyrant. Along the way, they also meet other survivors, including a young girl named Sherry Birkin, who is hunted by the dangerous Umbrella Corporation.

The game features puzzles, exploration, and intense combat as players fight to survive and uncover the truth behind the outbreak. Ultimately, Leon and Claire must work together to escape Raccoon City before it is destroyed by a missile strike.
